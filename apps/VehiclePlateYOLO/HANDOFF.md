## Goal

A real-time, fully on-device license-plate detection demo for Flutter (iOS + Android), powered by a single-pass YOLOv8n detector through the ZETIC Melange SDK. Streams the live camera feed, runs detection each frame on-device inside a long-lived dedicated inference isolate, and overlays labeled plate boxes with a live plate-count + pipeline-latency HUD. Single class (license_plate), no OCR, no two-stage vehicle-crop chain.

## Todo List

- [x] Create core Flutter structure (loading screen, camera screen, theme, HUD, detection overlay).
- [x] Long-lived DEDICATED inference isolate: model create -> warm-up -> run -> close all owned inside the isolate (FFI handle is isolate-bound). Main isolate sends frame bytes in (one copy), gets List<Detection> back. _busy frame-guard drops frames rather than queueing.
- [x] Melange lifecycle wrapper (ZeticMLangeModel.create -> Tensor.float32View -> run -> close), modelMode RUN_AUTO, version 1.
- [x] personalKey via String.fromEnvironment('ZETIC_KEY'); never hardcoded/committed. Clear on-screen error if the define is empty.
- [x] Preprocessing: letterbox 640x640 (pad 0.5), BGRA (iOS) / YUV420 (Android) -> RGB, /255 normalize, NCHW float32 [1,3,640,640], fused single reverse-mapped pass into a pre-allocated buffer (inline-BGRA hot path).
- [x] Post-processing: decode [1,5,8400] CHANNEL-major (stride c*8400+a), threshold-before-geometry (strict > 0.25), NO re-applied sigmoid (baked in), cxcywh->xyxy, un-letterbox, single-class GLOBAL NMS (IoU 0.45).
- [x] Detection overlay (BoxFit.cover mapping, repaint-on-change) + HUD with live count, pipeline latency, and a buf/rot/img diagnostic line for device orientation confirmation.
- [x] Tier A unit tests (9 named files, 10 cases) + A4 hot-path micro-benchmark.
- [x] Tier A1 analyze (in worktree): `flutter analyze` -> No issues found (0/0).
- [x] Tier A3 unit tests (in worktree): 10/10 pass.
- [x] Tier A4 benchmark (in worktree): median 2.90ms, p90 3.00ms (JIT; post-proc budget only, excludes the NPU model.run).
- [x] Tier B: applied + measured one structural optimization (inline-BGRA + format-hoist + reciprocal-multiply): 3.60ms -> 2.90ms median (~-19%, well over the 0.5% rule). Other levers applied by design (see Optimization log).
- [x] Committed to branch app/vehicleplate (commit subject "VehiclePlateYOLO: implement on-device license-plate detector (GATE 3)").
- [x] iOS deployment-target config: Podfile platform :ios, '16.6' + post_install IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET 16.6, project.pbxproj 13.0 -> 16.6 (x3), NSCameraUsageDescription added to Info.plist.
- [x] Android release config: minSdk 24, pinned AGP 8.9.1 / Kotlin 2.1.0 / Gradle 8.11.1, android.suppressUnsupportedCompileSdk=36, isMinifyEnabled=false + isShrinkResources=false (R8 strips Melange JNI classes otherwise), useLegacyPackaging for the .so's.
- [x] Tier A2 device-target release COMPILE (unsigned), both platforms GREEN:
  - iOS: `flutter build ios --release --no-codesign` -> pod install linked the vendored ZeticMLange.xcframework (device arm64), Xcode build done, built Runner.app (28.4MB).
  - Android: `flutter build apk --release` -> assembleRelease OK, built app-release.apk (196.1MB; large because minify is off, by design).
- [ ] **[BLOCKED – human, device-only]** iOS signing identity (team WVJ22PPYBP) + physical-device RUN in RELEASE (debug hangs on recent iOS/Xcode). The unsigned compile passes; only codesigning + the hardware run remain.
- [ ] Confirm served runtimeApType on the device console (expected NPU ~1.33ms; treat the console value as truth, not the dashboard number).

## Deliverables

- Flutter source under apps/VehiclePlateYOLO/Flutter/ (lib: main, theme, screens/{loading,camera}, services/{melange_service [dedicated isolate], preprocessor, postprocessor, nms, letterbox, orientation, frame_data}, models/detection, widgets/{detection_overlay, hud}).
- Tier A tests under Flutter/test/ (9 files, 10 cases) + test/benchmark/hot_path_benchmark.dart.
- Model assets (GATE 0): export.py, koushim-yolov8-license-plate.onnx, sample_input.npy, melange_upload.md, model_selection.md; registered Melange model ajayshah/VehiclePlateYOLO v1 (READY).

## Build command (device)

```
flutter run -d <UDID> --release --dart-define=ZETIC_KEY=<your_zetic_key>
```

(An empty ZETIC_KEY surfaces a clear on-screen error on the loading screen.)

## Device console (watch for served backend + native crashes)

```
xcrun devicectl device process launch --console --terminate-existing --device <UDID> com.zeticai.vehicleplateyolo
```

## Note on the mid-session macOS TCC revocation (now resolved)

During the dark build, macOS revoked the terminal's Full Disk Access, blocking all read/write/git under ~/Desktop (CLAUDE.md section 5). Work continued against a validated scratchpad mirror; after access was restored the validated copy was reconciled into this worktree and the full Tier A battery was re-run here before commit. Nothing was lost. The iOS/Android signing config remains the only outstanding (human/device-only) work.
