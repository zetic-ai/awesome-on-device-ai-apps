# VoxScribe (Flutter)

On-device, speaker-labeled live transcript demo for prospect **Kardome**. A
3-model ZETIC Melange pipeline runs entirely on the device:

1. **pyannote/segmentation-3.0** (`ajayshah/PyannoteSegmentation` v1) — "who
   spoke when" (powerset, 3 local speakers / 7 classes).
2. **Whisper-tiny encoder** (`OpenAI/whisper-tiny-encoder` v1) — log-mel → hidden.
3. **Whisper-tiny decoder** (`OpenAI/whisper-tiny-decoder` v1) — greedy 448-step
   decode → token ids → text.

Fusion is **diarize-then-transcribe**: each segmentation span is transcribed and
attributed to its speaker by construction. The floor input is a bundled ≤10 s,
2-speaker, 16 kHz mono clip (`assets/demo_2spk.wav`).

## Personal key (required)

The ZETIC personal key is injected at build time and is **never committed**:

```bash
flutter run       --release --dart-define=MLANGE_KEY=<your_zetic_key>
flutter build ios --release --dart-define=MLANGE_KEY=<your_zetic_key>
```

If the key is missing the loading screen fails loudly (no silent failure).

## Run (physical device only — no simulator)

The vendored `ZeticMLange.xcframework` ships a device-only `ios-arm64` slice and
must run in **release** mode (debug hangs on recent iOS). iOS 16.6+,
Android minSdk 24.

```bash
flutter build ios --release --dart-define=MLANGE_KEY=<key>
# then sign & install via Xcode / devicectl (see ../HANDOFF.md)
```

### Running on Android

Plug in an Android device (USB debugging on), then from `apps/VoxScribe/Flutter/`:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run --release -d <android-device-id> --dart-define=MLANGE_KEY=<your_zetic_key>
#   list devices with:  flutter devices
#   build an APK with:  flutter build apk --release --dart-define=MLANGE_KEY=<key>
```

minSdk 24. Debug keystore is fine for sideloading. The same `--dart-define` key
mechanism applies. No simulator/emulator (no camera/mic + the SDK is device-only).

## What's live vs scripted (IMPORTANT)

- **Segmentation ("who spoke when") is LIVE on-device.** ZETIC re-triggered the
  conversion with the LSTM issue fixed and re-registered as
  `ajayshah/pyannote-segmentation-3.0` — now CoreML/NPU-accelerated on Apple
  (~9.7 ms on iPhone 15) and numerically correct. The timeline is driven by the
  live model output; `kDemoReferenceSegments` is only a fallback if the model
  returns nothing.
- **Transcription is still scripted.** The on-device Whisper decoder OOM-crashes
  when looped (no-cache decoder emits ~93 MB/step → iOS signal 9, Bug 2), so the
  transcript is a precomputed script (`kDemoTranscript`) revealed word-by-word in
  sync with audio. Re-enable live transcription once a KV-cache decoder lands —
  see the `// DEMO TRANSCRIPTION` block in `pipeline_isolate.dart`.

### Known limitations (→ VoxScribe 2.0)
- On short clips with similar-sounding voices the model may merge turns / resolve
  fewer speakers (a model-accuracy limit, not a conversion bug).
- Live speaker slots aren't remapped to 1-based-by-first-appearance yet, so labels
  can read "Speaker 2/3" without a "Speaker 1".
- No cross-window clustering yet, so stable speaker identity is single-window only.

## Bundled assets

| Asset | What | Regenerate |
|---|---|---|
| `assets/demo_2spk.wav` | 2-speaker (overlapping) 16 kHz mono clip | macOS `say` + `tool/` (see ../HANDOFF.md) |
| `assets/vocab.json` | GPT-2 byte-level BPE vocab (Whisper) | copied from `apps/whisper-tiny` |
| `assets/mel_filters_80.bin` | OpenAI 80-mel Slaney filterbank `[80,201]` f32 LE | `python3 tool/gen_mel_filters.py assets/mel_filters_80.bin` |

The log-mel golden test vector is produced by `tool/gen_logmel_golden.py`.

## Tests

```bash
flutter test            # Tier A unit suite (14 traps)
flutter test test/benchmark/hot_path_benchmark.dart   # A4 micro-benchmark
```

The native NPU/CPU `run()` is device-only; per-stage latency and RTF are shown
on the in-app HUD (Dart `print` does not surface on a release device console).
